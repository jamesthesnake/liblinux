# Automatic build rule generation for object files

# Rule template for object files.
#
# The reason why objects depend on their dependency data file
# is to trigger the generation of dependency data when it is updated.
# Once generated, future executions of make will benefit from the dependency data.
# Dependency data file generation rules are defined in make/targets/dependencies.
#
# $(1) = path to source file
# $(2) = path to object file
# $(3) = path to dependency data file
# $(4) = linkage type
